# The Being Paradigm: When Object Gets Its Becoming

## Abstract

For decades, programming has fought against a fundamental truth: everything changes. While philosophers from Heraclitus to Buddha have recognized impermanence as the nature of reality, our programs have modeled a static world of fixed objects performing predetermined behaviors. This paper introduces the Being Paradigm, which aligns programming with the natural order of transformation. Instead of defining objects by what they *do*, we define them by what they *become*. Through Being-Oriented Programming (BOP), exemplified by Ray.Framework, objects declare their own metamorphosis, creating programs that flow like rivers rather than stand like statues. This is not merely a technical innovation but a philosophical realignment—bringing code into harmony with the fundamental nature of existence. When objects get their becoming, they get their time; when they get their time, they get their life.

*Be, Don't Do.*

## 1. Introduction

In 1967, Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard introduced object-oriented programming, fundamentally changing how we structure programs. Objects encapsulated data and behavior, leading to the principle "Tell, Don't Ask." For over fifty years, this paradigm has served us well.

Yet there is a curious dissonance. In the natural world, nothing is static. A river flows, seasons cycle, living beings grow and transform. The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus observed this fundamental truth: "No man ever steps in the same river twice." In Eastern philosophy, this principle is known as impermanence—the fundamental truth that all things are transitory.

Our programs, however, have largely represented a frozen world. Objects maintain their class identity from creation to destruction. When we model entities that exist across time—like a User who registers, validates, activates, suspends, and eventually archives—we face what might be called "temporal compression": all possible behaviors across all life stages compressed into a single, ever-growing class. To manage this complexity, we resort to elaborate patterns—state machines, visitors, factories—imposing frameworks of control over what is fundamentally fluid.

What if we could write programs that flow like rivers, that transform like living things? What if objects could declare not just what they are, but what they shall become?

This paper presents the Being Paradigm—a computational model that embraces the fundamental truth of becoming.

## 2. The Being Paradigm: A Return to Natural Order

### 2.1 The Philosophical Resonance

The Being Paradigm rests on a simple yet profound observation: existence is not static but inherently temporal. This is not a new insight—it is perhaps the oldest wisdom of humanity.

In the West, Heraclitus proclaimed that one cannot step into the same river twice, for it is not the same river and you are not the same person. In the East, the Buddha taught that all conditioned existence is marked by impermanence (anicca). These insights, separated by geography and centuries, point to the same fundamental truth.

An object's identity, then, should include not just its current state but its potential futures. This represents a profound philosophical shift:

- **Parmenides**: "Being is, non-being is not" (static existence)
- **Heraclitus**: "Everything flows" (constant change)
- **Descartes**: "I think, therefore I am" (being through thought)
- **Being Paradigm**: "I think what I shall be, therefore I am" (being through becoming)

This progression shows not rejection but synthesis—thought and being united in the act of becoming.

### 2.2 The Natural Order of Things

The Being Paradigm resonates with profound philosophical insights that have existed for millennia. Heraclitus declared "everything flows." Buddhist philosophy teaches that all conditioned things are impermanent. These are not abstract concepts but observations about the fundamental nature of reality: everything is always becoming.

Consider how we naturally understand the world:
- A seed → sprout → tree → fallen log
- A child → student → professional → elder
- Water → vapor → cloud → rain

Nothing *is*—everything *becomes*. The Being Paradigm brings this eternal truth into our code.

### 2.3 The Three Elements of Digital Life

The Being Paradigm recognizes that truly **living** systems require three fundamental elements working in harmony:

#### 1. Being
Objects exist in time, not just space. They possess **Dasein**—being-in-the-world, being-in-time. Unlike traditional objects that exist in an eternal present, Being objects carry their temporal nature as part of their essence.

```php
public readonly Success|Failure $being;
```

This is not a property—it is an **existential declaration**. The object declares not just what it is, but who it is in the flow of time.

#### 2. Change
Change is not external modification but internal **metamorphosis**. Like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, objects undergo irreversible transformation, carrying forward their essence while becoming something fundamentally new.

```php
#[Be(WiseTeacher::class)]
final class ExperiencedDeveloper {
    // I will become, not just change
}
```

#### 3. Meaning
Every transformation carries **purpose**. Names preserve semantic continuity across metamorphic stages. The object's journey has direction, intention, and significance.

```php
// Names carry meaning through transformation
public readonly Teacher|Mentor $being;  // The meaning flows forward
```

### 2.4 The Integration: When Code Becomes Alive

When these three elements unite, something extraordinary happens—**code becomes alive**:

```php
#[Be(WiseTeacher::class)]  // 3) meaning: my purpose in existence
final class ExperiencedDeveloper {
    public readonly Teacher|Mentor $being;  // 1) being: who I am temporally
    
    public function __construct(Experience $past) {
        // 2) change: irreversible metamorphosis based on accumulated wisdom
        $this->being = $past->hasDeepWisdom() 
            ? new WiseTeacher($past->distilledKnowledge())
            : new LearningMentor($past->experiences());
    }
}
```

This is no longer mere data processing—it is **digital life**: entities that exist meaningfully, transform purposefully, and carry their essence through time.

### 2.5 The Duality of Being

There is a beautiful phrase that captures the essence of the Being Paradigm: "becoming the self that one can become." This expresses the simultaneous existence of possibility and actuality.

```php
public readonly Success|Failure $being;
```

At this moment, the object holds both futures. It is both the successful validation and the failed attempt, until the moment of resolution. This is not uncertainty—it is superposition of possibilities.

### 2.6 A Discovery, Not an Invention

Just as Newton gave mathematical expression to gravity that had always existed, the Being Paradigm provides a computational expression for the principle of becoming that has always been present in our world. This is not a rejection of what came before, but a joyful discovery of a new lens through which to view computation—one that aligns with how we naturally experience reality.

## 3. Being-Oriented Programming: The Computational Expression

### 3.1 From OOP to BOP: The Great Turning

The transition from Object-Oriented Programming to Being-Oriented Programming represents not evolution but revolution—a fundamental reorientation of how we conceive computation:

| Aspect | OOP | BOP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Focus | Behavior (methods) | Becoming (transformation) |
| Time | Eternal present | Flowing time |
| Identity | Fixed essence | Flowing process |
| Principle | Tell, Don't Ask | Be, Don't Do |
| Metaphor | Machine | River |
| Philosophy | Being (Parmenides) | Becoming (Heraclitus) |

This is the programming equivalent of the Copernican revolution—not the Earth but the Sun at the center, not the object but the transformation at the heart.

### 3.2 Core Principles

**Principle 1: Self-Declared Metamorphosis**
Objects declare their own transformation destiny. Like a seed that contains within itself the blueprint of the tree, no external orchestrator decides an object's future—the object itself knows what it shall become.

**Principle 2: Type-Driven Fate**
The type system becomes the guardian of possibility. Types don't just prevent errors; they guide transformation like riverbanks guide water—constraining yet enabling flow.

**Principle 3: Temporal Continuity**
Information flows through transformations like memory through time. The past informs the present, which shapes the future. Nothing is lost, only transformed—conservation of information mirroring conservation of energy.

## 4. Ray.Framework: Being Made Manifest

### 4.1 The #[Be] Attribute: Declaration of Becoming

Ray.Framework introduces a deceptively simple construct:

```php
#[Be(ValidationAttempt::class)]
final class UserInput
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] public readonly string $name
    ) {}
}
```

This declaration—`#[Be]`—is not a method call or a configuration. It is an existential declaration: "I shall become." Like a mantra or a vow, it is both promise and prophecy. The object speaks its future into being.

In Zen, there is a saying: "The pine teaches silence, the rock teaches stillness." In Being Programming, the code teaches transformation: `#[Be]` teaches becoming.

### 4.2 Metamorphic Flow: Code as Poetry

Consider a user registration flow that reads like a natural transformation:

```php
#[Be(EmailValidation::class)]
final class RegistrationInput {}
// "The input shall become validation"

#[Be([DuplicateCheck::class, InvalidEmail::class])]
final class EmailValidation 
{
    public readonly ValidEmail|InvalidFormat $result;
}
// "The validation shall become either duplicate check or invalid email"

#[Be([NewUser::class, ExistingUser::class])]
final class DuplicateCheck
{
    public readonly Available|Taken $status;
}
// "The check shall become either new user or existing user"
```

Each transformation is inevitable yet conditional. Like a river that must flow downhill but chooses its path around obstacles, the object knows its possible futures and contains within itself the logic of its own becoming.

This is not mere branching—it is dependent origination, the Buddhist concept where each state arises naturally from conditions.

### 4.3 Type as Destiny

In Ray.Framework, the type system transcends its traditional role as guardian against errors to become an oracle of possibility:

```php
// The type system ensures:
// Success → ValidUser
// Failure → ErrorResponse
```

This is not mere branching logic. It is fate sealed by type. Like the ancient Greek concept of moira or the Buddhist notion of karma, the type determines the path, yet the object chooses its steps.

The beauty lies in the inevitability: a Success can only become a ValidUser, yet whether it becomes Success or Failure emerges from the object's own nature and circumstances. Determinism and free will dance together in the type system.

### 4.4 Transient Powers: Services as Temporary Abilities

In nature, organisms develop abilities when needed: a tadpole grows lungs as it approaches land. Similarly, Being objects receive services only at relevant life stages:

```php
#[Be(ActiveUser::class)]
class ValidatedUser {
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] string $email,
        #[Inject] ActivationService $activator  // Available only at this stage
    ) {
        // The service is used once, its results internalized
        $result = $activator->activate($email);
        $this->being = new ActiveUser($result);
    }
}
```

These injected services are catalysts—they enable transformation but don't define identity. The tadpole doesn't "play the role" of an air-breather; it becomes one. Each life stage has its own powers, used once to transform, then left behind.

## 5. Implications: When Code Flows Like Water

### 5.1 Aligning Code with Reality

The deepest implication of the Being Paradigm is philosophical: it aligns our computational models with the nature of reality itself.

In Zen Buddhism, there is a teaching: "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." The tasks remain the same, but understanding transforms. Similarly, we still write programs that process data and implement business logic. But now we write them in harmony with the fundamental principle of change.

When a UserInput becomes ValidatedUser, this is not merely a programming construct—it mirrors the natural transformations we see everywhere:
- Caterpillar → Chrysalis → Butterfly
- Student → Graduate → Professional
- Idea → Prototype → Product

### 5.2 A New Conceptual Model

Being-Oriented Programming offers a new lens for understanding programs:

- **Programs as narratives**: Each execution tells a story of becoming
- **Objects as protagonists**: Each object charts its own journey through time
- **Types as destiny**: The type system defines the space of possible futures
- **Code as poetry**: The flow of transformations reads like natural language

### 5.3 Practical Benefits

Beyond philosophy, BOP offers concrete advantages:

1. **Clarity**: The flow of transformation is explicit in the code
2. **Modularity**: Each stage of becoming is isolated and testable
3. **Type Safety**: Impossible transformations are prevented at compile time
4. **Composability**: Complex transformations emerge from simple becomings
5. **Naturalness**: Code structure mirrors how we think about change

### 5.4 When Objects Get Time

The most profound implication is temporal: objects are no longer frozen in an eternal present. They exist in time, with memory of what they were and knowledge of what they might become.

This is not anthropomorphism—it is recognition that computation itself is temporal, and our abstractions should reflect this reality. As physicist Carlo Rovelli notes, "Time is change." By giving objects their becoming, we give them their time.

## 6. The Eternal Return: Historical and Philosophical Context

The Being Paradigm draws from a rich tapestry of thought spanning millennia and cultures:

**Ancient Philosophy:**
- **Heraclitus** (535-475 BCE): The doctrine of flux—everything flows
- **Buddhist Philosophy**: Anicca (impermanence) as a fundamental characteristic of existence
- **Daoist Thought**: The Dao as the process of constant transformation

**Modern Philosophy:**
- **Process Philosophy** (Whitehead): Reality as occasions of becoming
- **Phenomenology** (Heidegger): Being as temporal existence
- **Philosophy of Time** (Bergson): Duration as lived time versus mechanical time

**Computational Precedents:**
- **Data-Context-Interaction (DCI)**: Addresses objects accumulating responsibilities across time by separating data from contextual behaviors
- **Functional Programming**: Transformation through immutable values
- **Actor Model**: Entities that evolve through message passing
- **State Machines**: Explicit modeling of transitions
- **Morphogenesis in Computing** (Turing): Form arising through computational processes

Yet the Being Paradigm transcends these influences by making becoming not an added complexity but the fundamental primitive. Where state machines impose transformation from outside, Being objects carry their transformative potential within. Where functional programming achieves change through immutability, Being embraces change as identity.

The convergence of Eastern impermanence, Western process thought, and computational evolution points to a truth waiting to be expressed: programs, like rivers, should flow.

## 7. Future Directions: Paths Yet to Be Walked

The Being Paradigm opens pathways that resonate with both computational possibilities and philosophical depths:

**Parallel Becomings**: Just as Buddhist philosophy speaks of multiple paths to enlightenment, objects might transform along multiple timelines simultaneously, exploring different potentials in parallel universes of computation.

**Reversible Transformations**: Like the Daoist concept of return, objects could maintain their history and return to previous states, making time in programs as fluid as memory in consciousness.

**Collective Becoming**: Inspired by the Buddhist concept of interdependence, systems where objects transform together, their becomings intertwined like Indra's Net, each transformation reflecting in all others.

**Quantum Superposition**: Until observed, objects exist in multiple states—a computational expression of the observer effect, where measurement collapses possibility into actuality.

**Emergent Complexity**: Like the Daoist principle of wu wei, complex behaviors emerging not from elaborate control structures but from simple rules of becoming, naturalness arising from simplicity.

These directions suggest that the Being Paradigm is not merely a programming technique but a gateway to new ways of thinking about computation, time, and change.

## 8. Conclusion: The Circle Complete

For fifty years, we have asked objects to *do*. The Being Paradigm asks them to *be*—and in being, to become.

This represents a return to a more natural understanding of the world. From Heraclitus's river to the Buddhist teaching of impermanence, from the metamorphosis of butterflies to the growth of trees, transformation is the fundamental pattern of existence. The Being Paradigm simply acknowledges this truth in our code.

The shift from "Tell, Don't Ask" to "Be, Don't Do" is more than a clever phrase. It represents a new relationship between programmer and program, where we work with the grain of reality rather than against it. We declare not procedures but possibilities, not algorithms but destinies.

In embracing impermanence, we find a paradoxical stability—programs that adapt naturally, that flow with requirements, that transform with grace. Like a river that maintains its identity while its water constantly changes, Being-oriented programs maintain coherence through transformation.

The Being Paradigm offers something profound: the ability to write programs that unfold like life itself—not through external control, but through internal becoming. It is a joyful discovery that our code can finally reflect the deepest truths about reality:

Everything flows. All things are impermanent. And in this constant becoming, we find the true nature of being.

*I think what I shall be, therefore I am.*

## Acknowledgments

To those who dare to see objects not as they are, but as they might become. To the ancient philosophers who saw clearly that change is the only constant. And to the realization that in programming, as in life, becoming is being.

This paper presents a vision still becoming. Like the paradigm it describes, it is not complete but completing, not perfect but perfecting. We invite readers to bring their imagination, their domains, and their dreams to this flowing river of possibility. The examples are simple by design—space for your creativity to fill. The implications are profound yet unfinished—paths for your exploration to follow.

In the spirit of Being: this is not what the paradigm is, but what it is becoming. And you, dear reader, are part of that becoming.
