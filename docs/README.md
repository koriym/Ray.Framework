# Ray.Framework Documentation

This directory contains the foundational documents for Ray.Framework:

## Core Documents

### [Ontological Programming: A New Paradigm](ontological-programming-paper.md)
The philosophical foundation that introduces Ontological Programming—a paradigm where we program by defining what can exist, rather than what should happen. This document explores the theoretical underpinnings that inspired Ray.Framework.

### [Ray.Framework Whitepaper](ray-framework-whitepaper.md)
The philosophical and technical foundations of Ray.Framework. This document shows how Ray.Framework implements the Ontological Programming concepts through the Metamorphic Programming paradigm.

### [Metamorphosis Architecture Manifesto](metamorphosis-architecture-manifesto.md)
A practical guide to implementing the Metamorphosis Architecture. This document provides concrete patterns, including the Traffic Controller pattern for branching and the Spy pattern for testing.

## Reading Order

1. Start with **Ontological Programming** to understand the fundamental philosophy
2. Continue with the **Ray.Framework Whitepaper** to see how these concepts are realized
3. Then read the **Manifesto** for practical implementation guidance
