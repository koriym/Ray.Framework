# Ray.Framework Documentation

This directory contains the foundational documents for Ray.Framework:

## Core Documents

### [Ontological Programming: A New Paradigm](ontological-programming-paper.md)
The philosophical foundation that introduces Ontological Programming—a paradigm where we program by defining what can exist, rather than what should happen. This document explores the theoretical underpinnings that inspired Ray.Framework.

### [Ray.Framework Whitepaper](ray-framework-whitepaper.md)
The philosophical and technical foundations of Ray.Framework. This document shows how Ray.Framework implements the Ontological Programming concepts through the Metamorphic Programming paradigm.

### [Metamorphosis Architecture Manifesto](metamorphosis-architecture-manifesto.md)
A practical guide to implementing the Metamorphosis Architecture. This document provides concrete patterns, including the Traffic Controller pattern for branching and the Spy pattern for testing.

### [UNIX Pipes and Ray.Framework](unix-pipes-vs-ray-framework.md)
An illuminating comparison between UNIX pipes and Ray.Framework, showing how the pipeline philosophy evolves from text streams to typed domain objects. Essential reading for understanding Ray.Framework's place in computing history.

2. Continue with the **Ray.Framework Whitepaper** to see how these concepts are realized
3. Then read the **Manifesto** for practical implementation guidance
4. Explore **UNIX Pipes and Ray.Framework** to understand the historical context and evolution
